## Links ðŸ”—

Websites I've used on the regular while working out.
- **https://liftvault.com/**
    - Great site to find a workout spreadsheet to track progress as you go. Although results may vary sometimes having a workout goal on paper is a good motivator to push beyond what you're used to.
- **https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index/**
    - Although the subreddit has been pretty dead for some time the wiki is still a good source of body weight exercises and FAQs to refer to.

        - During quarantine I used this spreadsheet to try and keep up my fitness at home.
## YouTube Channels ðŸ“º
Channels that have been helpful for my lifting journey from being informational or inspiring.
### Informative
- **https://www.youtube.com/@BrianAlsruheOfficial**
	- A life saver when it comes to learning cues and proper bracing. I'll have another post with his videos and breaking them down into text form. 
- **https://www.youtube.com/@SquatUniversity**
	- Has been a great help teaching techniques to increase mobility and treating muscular deficiencies. Recently, the click bait has gone up but the message is still good. 
- **https://www.youtube.com/@AlanThrall**
	- This channel doesn't really stand out but he has a deadlifting tutorial video I still follow to some extent and I think the videos he puts out are good to listen to. 
- **https://www.youtube.com/@trainerwinny**
	- Just found this channel and like the simple format enough to put him on here.
- **https://www.youtube.com/@PictureFit**
	- Article based short videos about fitness. Mostly the conclusion is "it depends" but the topics are good conversation. 
### Fun

	- Powerlifting Highlights
- **https://www.youtube.com/@sam_sulek**
	- Was pretty popular in 2023 for his chill style vlogs and relatable content. I still put his videos on while doing the dishes and he drops nuggets of wisdom here and there.

	- Vietnamese Dad who can bench 400lbs+ at 150lbs bodyweight. Most of his videos are of his family and fishing but man does he push a lot of weight. Here's [the program](https://gravitus.com/blog/ufpwrlifter-path-to-410lb-bench-press/) he posted in 2016.

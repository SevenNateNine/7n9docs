Recently, I've been having a lot of repeating conservations and realized a desire to have a place where my thoughts could be concise, consistent and easily shared if needed. The solution formed into this website where I can coalesce my thoughts with various sources across the internet and reiterate these conversations in a (hopefully) well structured manner that I could only partially do before. The goal is not to just plug this site in the middle of every conversation but to create concious effort to form meaningful conversations and maybe plug this site in the middle of the conversation.

## What is Divided By Eight?
A repository of thoughts coalesced with reputable sources to form concise and consistent information in the form of various documentation and blogs. Made into a website for a more visually appealing repository than Github with possibly more bells and whistles. 

The image on this post is provided by [undraw.co](https://undraw.co/) and the icon is made by Adobe Express' [logo maker](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo).
## How is it made? 
Powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static-site generator powered by React, hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a web development platform for deployments with the content living in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repo. It was pretty quick to spin up this application and just focus on the hard stuff, **writing**.
